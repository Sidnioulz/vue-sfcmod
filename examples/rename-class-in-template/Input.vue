      and when we speak we are afraid
      <br />
      our words will not be heard
      <br />
      nor welcomed
      <br />
      but when we are silent
      <br />
      we are still afraid
      <br />
      So it is better to speak
      <br />
      remembering
      <br />
      we were never meant to survive
