    <h1>Clara Campoamor Rodríguez</h1>
    <h2>Early days</h2>
    Clara Campoamor Rodríguez was born on 12 February 1888 in Madrid, Spain to a working-class
    family, she began working as a seamstress at age 13, but continued to study part-time on the
    side, eventually seeking to pass the test that would guarantee her entry into law school. In the
    interim, she worked her way up through a number of government positions, first with the Post
    Office in San Sebastián in 1909, then as a typing teacher back in Madrid in 1914.
    <h2>Political debut</h2>
    In addition to her job as a teacher, Campoamor became involved in the Madrid political scene
    through a second job as a journalist at the newspaper La Tribuna, where she got in touch with
    influential feminine figures of the time, such as Carmen de Burgos and Eva Nelken. These
    acquaintances led Clara Campoamor to join and collaborate with various feminist associations and
    to write political commentary.
    <h2>Law practice</h2>
    After successfully passing the law school entrance exam and entering the University of Madrid
    School of Law, Campoamor continued to work multiple jobs until she earned her degree in 1924,
    aged 36, and entered legal practice. Campoamor was the second woman to ever incorporate the
    Madrid Bar Association, the first one to defend a case before the Spanish High Court, and one of
    the first to represent Spain in the League of Nations. Her private practice specialized in
    issues affecting women, including paternity cases and marital law. Campoamor successfully
    advocated in 1927 for improvements to the child labor laws and electoral law changes. When it
    became legal for women to run for the Constituent Assembly that would write a new constitution
    in 1931, she stood for a seat and was elected despite her inability to vote in the election.
    <h2>An advocate for women's suffrage</h2>
    On October of the same year, and using her position in the constituent assembly, she became the
    first woman to address it, in a memorable speech warning the male members of the assembly that
    their continued exclusion of women from voting was a violation of natural law: “To all deputies:
    I am a citizen before. And I reckon it would be a tremendous political mistake not to allow
    women to exercise this right, women that look up to and trust you; women that, similarly to the
    French Revolution, will undoubtedly be a new power to our laws, and you only have to open their
    way”. Campoamor affirmed that a Republic could not be built without half the citizenship of the
    country and thus, women needed to be given the right to vote.
